Each row in the *wine* data set represents data on a particular wine, and the columns are the wines’ attributes. The first 11 columns of the data contain measurements for various aspects of the wine, such as its *fixed acidity* level, *density*, and percentage of *alcohol*. The *quality* variable is an expert’s ranking of the quality of the wine on a 1-10 scale, with 1 being the lowest rating, and 10 the highest. The *Class* variable has values of 1 for all wines with a quality score of 7 or higher, and 0 for quality scores below 7.

    "As temperatures creep up across the winemaking world, many winemakers, especially in traditionally cooler climates, such as those in Oregon and Washington, are having to figure out how to keep alcohol levels in check. In Oregon in 2009, for example, cumulative growing degree day values for many areas were up 4 to 14 percent over 2008. Because alcohol is a product of fermentation, the riper the grape at the moment when yeast converts grape sugar into alcohol, the higher the wine’s alcohol level is likely to be. The data used for this final exam comes from the Minho region of Portugal, which may be experiencing similar changes in temperatures."

    "Are red wines of higher quality than white wines? A better question might be: do experts rate red wines more highly than white wines? One expert method of rating wines involves a 1-50 point scale (which has been simplified in this dataset to a 1-10 scale). The wine gets up to 5 points on color, up to 15 on bouquet and aroma, and up to 20 points on flavor, harmony and length. The balance of 10 points are awarded to wines that have the ability to improve in the bottle. Because of that 10-point cushion, points are assigned to the overall quality but also to the potential period of time that wine can provide pleasure. White Burgundies today have a lifespan of, at most, a decade with rare exceptions. Most top red wines can last 15 years and most top Bordeaux can last 20, 25 years. \n",

The *Class* variable can be used to denote high quality, having values of 1 for all wines with a quality score of 7 or higher, and 0 for quality scores below 7. Perform a hypothesis test (at the 0.05 significance level) to examine this claim.\n",
