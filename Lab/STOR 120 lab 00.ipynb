    "Welcome to STOR 120: *Foundations of Statistics and Data Science*!  Most weeks you will complete a lab assignment. You can't learn technical subjects without hands-on practice, so labs are an important part of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborating on labs is more than okay -- it's encouraged! You should rarely remain stuck for more than a few minutes on questions in labs, so ask a classmate or an instructor for help. (Explaining things is beneficial, too -- the best way to solidify your knowledge of a subject is to explain it.) Please don't just share answers, though.\n",

    "2. open your first Jupyter notebook (like this one);\n",
    "3. run one *cell* to install a needed package (which may already be installed);\n",
    "4. change one *cell* of the notebook;\n",
